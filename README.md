# WikipediaScraper

This is a simple class and some scripts for scraping data from Wikipedia. Primary functionality is handled by the 
WikipediaPage class and the GetRandomPage and GetRandomTitles functions. Files under the scripts directory can be
used to write ngrams and titles to file for later use.
